# World: Map & Level Design

## 1. The New World Strategic Map
The map is a sprawling continent divided into political territories.

*   **Region: The Kingdom of Re-Estize**
    *   *Geography:* Rolling plains, dense forests.
    *   *Key Locations:* E-Rantel (Fortress City), Re-Laven (Capital), Carne Village.
    *   *Difficulty:* Low (Starting area).
*   **Region: The Baharuth Empire**
    *   *Geography:* Well-maintained roads, sophisticated architecture.
    *   *Key Locations:* Arwintar (Imperial Capital), The Imperial Academy.
    *   *Difficulty:* Medium.
*   **Region: The Slane Theocracy**
    *   *Geography:* Holy cities, mountain fortifications.
    *   *Key Locations:* The Central Cathedral (High-level raid).
    *   *Difficulty:* High (Late-game rival).
*   **Region: The Dragon Kingdom & Beastman Country**
    *   *Geography:* Deserts and rugged mountains.
    *   *Difficulty:* Very High.

## 2. Nazarick Level Design (Internal)
While the Strategy Map is a hex-grid, internal Nazarick levels are designed for the **Tomb Management** and **Defense** phases.

*   **The 1st-3rd Floors (Catacombs):** Dark, narrow corridors, gothic architecture. Designed for trap-stacking and ambushes.
*   **The 6th Floor (Coliseum & Jungle):** A massive open-air forest under a simulated sky. Features a central arena for NPC duels and training.
*   **The 9th Floor (Living Quarters):** Luxury hotel aesthetic. Marble floors, chandeliers, and high-end suites. This is where Ainz interacts with Guardians for "Social" missions.
*   **The 10th Floor (Throne Room):** The "Gold Room." Grand, intimidating, and filled with the symbols of the 41 Supreme Beings.

## 3. The Battlefield Levels (ARPG)
When a battle occurs in a specific hex, a 3D environment is generated based on the terrain type.

*   **Open Field (The Katze Plains):** A barren, foggy wasteland. Ideal for massive army vs. army clashes and using Super-Tier magic.
*   **City Siege:** Urban combat. Narrow streets, destructible buildings, and defensive walls that can be breached by heavy units.
*   **Dungeon Raid:** Exploring ancient ruins or enemy fortresses (like the Eight Greed Kings' castle). Focuses on corridor combat and boss rooms.

## 4. Points of Interest (POIs)
*   **World Tree Fragments:** Ancient locations that grant Ainz permanent buffs to YGGDRASIL Gold production.
*   **Ancient Libraries:** Capturing these unlocks "Lost Spells" for Ainz.
*   **Legendary Smithies:** Unlocks the ability to craft "God-Tier" gear.
