# Narrative: Campaign Structure & Quests

## 1. Main Campaign: The Rise of Ainz Ooal Gown
The story follows the core light novel events but allows for player agency in how those events are executed.

*   **Act 1: The Arrival (Vols 1-3)**
    *   *Focus:* Securing Carne Village, infiltrating E-Rantel as Momon, and the Brainwashing of Shalltear.
    *   *Climax:* Boss fight against Shalltear Bloodfallen (Manual combat).
*   **Act 2: The Foundations (Vols 4-9)**
    *   *Focus:* Subjugating the Lizardmen, the "Gehenna" event in the Capital, and the establishment of the Sorcerer Kingdom.
    *   *Climax:* The Massacre at Katze Plains.
*   **Act 3: World Domination (Vols 10-16+)**
    *   *Focus:* Vassalizing the Empire, the Holy Kingdom conflict, and the final war against the Theocracy.
    *   *Climax:* Duel against the Platinum Dragon Lord.

## 2. The "Sasuga" Dialogue System
Narrative is driven by choices that affect the **Sasuga Meter**.

*   *Scenario:* Ainz is thinking "I just want to be safe," but the dialogue options are:
    1.  [Intimidating] "This is all according to my 10,000-year plan."
    2.  [Ruthless] "Execute them all. They are not worth my time."
    3.  [Momon] "I will handle this personally, as a hero."
*   *Outcome:* These choices change which missions unlock and how world leaders react to you (Fear vs. Respect).

## 3. "What If" Scenarios (Side Campaigns)
Unlocked by specific choices or high/low Sasuga levels.

*   **The Blue Roses Defection:** Convincing Lakyus and the Blue Roses to join Nazarick instead of fleeing.
*   **The Dragon Lord Alliance:** What if Ainz tried to negotiate with the True Dragon Lords early on?
*   **The Player Return:** A mysterious "New Player" arrives. Are they a friend from the old guild or a new enemy?

## 4. Quest Types
*   **Grand Strategy Quests:** "Conquer the Re-Estize Kingdom in 50 turns."
*   **Nazarick Defense Quests:** "Defeat 3 waves of workers without using Guardians."
*   **Momon Quests:** "Reach Gold Rank in the Adventurer's Guild."
*   **Guardian Personal Quests:** Narrative-focused missions that increase Guardian Loyalty and unlock unique items (e.g., Albedo’s "Search Party" or Shalltear’s "Redemption").
