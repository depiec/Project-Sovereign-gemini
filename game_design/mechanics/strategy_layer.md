# Game Mechanic: The Throne Room (Grand Strategy Layer)

## 1. Overview
The **Throne Room** is the strategic heart of *Overlord: Supreme Being*. Played from a top-down, hex-based perspective of the New World, this layer challenges players to expand the influence of the Great Tomb of Nazarick. Unlike traditional 4X games where you play as a god-like observer, here you play specifically as **Ainz Ooal Gown**, sitting on the Throne of Kings, receiving reports from Guardians, and making decisions that shape the world.

## 2. The "Sasuga" System (Supreme Being Authority)
This unique mechanic simulates the comedy and tension of Ainz attempting to live up to the impossible genius his subordinates ascribe to him.

*   **Concept:** Your Guardians (especially Demiurge and Albedo) constantly devise brilliant, ruthless plans. You must navigate these interactions without revealing your own incompetence.
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   **The Proposal:** At the start of a turn, a Guardian will propose a plan (e.g., "Demiurge suggests infiltrating the Empire").
    *   **The Reaction:** You have three dialogue/action choices:
        1.  **"Umu, exactly as I thought." (Approve):** Executes the plan as is. High success chance, but high resource cost. Increases **Sasuga** slightly.
        2.  **"Perhaps we should consider..." (Modify):** Allows you to tweak parameters (e.g., lower budget, change target). Risk: If the tweak fails, **Sasuga** drops significantly ("Did I misinterpret Ainz-sama's will?").
        3.  **"I shall leave the details to you." (Delegate):** Lowers immediate resource cost but increases the chance of "happy accidents" (e.g., accidentally conquering a village you wanted to save).
    *   **Sasuga Meter:**
        *   **High:** NPCs get buffs to morale and efficiency. Unique "World Domination" stratagems unlock.
        *   **Low:** NPCs become overprotective, restricting your movement ("It is too dangerous for Ainz-sama to go outside"). They may execute unauthorized plans to "remove threats" to you.

## 3. Diplomacy: Vassalage vs. Destruction
Conquest isn't just painting the map; it's about resource extraction.

*   **Vassalage (The "Candy"):**
    *   **Method:** Intimidation, political marriage (suggested by Albedo, usually ignored), or economic pressure.
    *   **Benefit:** Generates **Gold (YGGDRASIL Currency)** and **Food/Materials**.
    *   **Unique Unit:** **Vassal Levies** (Human/Demihuman troops that don't cost Nazarick resources).
    *   **Risk:** Rebellions if fear levels drop.

*   **Destruction (The "Whip"):**
    *   **Method:** Sending Cocytus or Shalltear to wipe out a hex.
    *   **Benefit:** Generates **Souls**.
    *   **Use of Souls:**
        *   Fuel for high-tier **Mercenary Summons** (e.g., Hanzo, level 80+ monsters).
        *   Fuel for **Wild Magic** countermeasures (World Item recharging).
    *   **Risk:** High "World Threat" generation. Triggers "Hero Alliances" and potential Dragon Lord intervention.

## 4. Espionage & Operations
Before armies march, shadows move.

*   **The Happy Farm (Demiurge):**
    *   **Function:** Resource generation facility.
    *   **Input:** "Bipedal Sheep" (Abducted civilians from enemy tiles).
    *   **Output:** **Scrolls** (for magic casting) and **Skins** (crafting materials).
    *   **Risk:** High Karma penalty. If discovered by "Good" aligned factions, it triggers an immediate Crusade.

*   **Butler's Grace (Sebas Tian):**
    *   **Function:** Intelligence and "Good Cop" diplomacy.
    *   **Action:** Deploy Sebas to a city. He gathers intel on high-level threats (e.g., identifying a hidden Player or World Item user).
    *   **Passive:** Lowers local unrest.

*   **Doppelgänger Infiltration (Pandora's Actor/Naraberal):**
    *   Replace a key VIP (noble, general) with a Doppelgänger.
    *   Allows you to sabotage enemy defenses or open gates before a siege.

## 5. Resource Economy
*   **YGGDRASIL Gold:** Finite and non-renewable (mostly). Used to resurrect Guardians and maintain Guild functions.
    *   *Gain:* Taxing vassals, finding ancient treasures, using the "Exchange Box" (convert raw materials to gold at a terrible ratio).
*   **Souls:** Renewable. Used for summoning high-tier mercenaries.
*   **Data Crystals:** Dropped by "Player" tier enemies. Used to craft God-tier equipment.

## 6. The World Map
*   **Hex-Based:** Movement is determined by unit speed.
*   **Fog of War:** Only areas with surveillance (Hanzo units, scrying mirrors) are visible.
*   **Key Locations:**
    *   **Nazarick:** Your capital. Impenetrable but immobile.
    *   **E-Rantel:** Early game fortress city target.
    *   **Slane Theocracy:** End-game threat (high magic resistance, World Items).
    *   **Eruan Shu (Floating Castle):** A high-level dungeon raid location.
